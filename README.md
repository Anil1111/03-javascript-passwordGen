# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Homework 03 UCB bootcamp - Create and deploy a password generator using javascript.  The app prompts the user if they want special characters, upper-case letters, lower-case letters, and numbers.  It will also ask the user to tell the app how long they want the password to be and can choose to have from 8 characters to 128 characters.


## Building the project
...

Using javascript I used confirms on the questions about the parameters of the passsword. Store the information into a varible for number crunching.  
Using a while loop if the user does not put in the a correct length the confirm will keep appearing until the correct condition is met preventing the user to move forward.
Created functions and used built in javascript methods and math functions
Using the HTML and CSS provided, once the user answers all the questions they can simply click on the generate password button and their new password will appear. The generate password function runs everytime the user clicks generate password button and will keep the parameters for the PW until the user refreshes the page and choose different options.

Building this javascript PW generator had some challenges. Psuedo-coding and refactoring was key to building this app. Receiving important help from the TA's and my tutor were necessary to fully understand the flow of the project.




Things I did in the project

1.) Declared multiple variables 
2.) While loops, if statements, and DOM manipulation.
3.) Achieved of having a pw generate random password with user input to make them unique.
